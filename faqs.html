                    <p>Every time you book an element of travel online, or direct with a hotel, you are giving commission away to the site you are booking through - <strong>commission that is already there</strong> - built into the price you are seeing right in front of you.</p>
                    <p>When you become an Independent Travel Agent and partner with us, you will gain access to your very own booking system which will allow <strong>you to earn that commission back!</strong> You can book just for yourself, for friends and family or build up a client base - entirely up to you! You will earn commission back on everything you book!</p>
