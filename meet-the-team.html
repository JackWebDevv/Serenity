                                <p>Hi my name is Yasmin, I'm just a normal 21 year old girl who had a dream to become successful! I started this business ONLY 4 months ago and little did I know it would change my life forever!</p>
                                <p>Before this business I was stuck in a 9-5 job and couldn't work out a way out of the "normal" until I got introduced to this incredible business. I LOVE to travel and heard about the massive earning potential and the freedom of working anywhere in the world remotely which was a no brainer for me!</p>
                                <p>I am so grateful how far this opportunity has taken me already and that now I can help others to see the huge potential in this business and hopefully change your life as much as it has changed mine. Quite a pinch me moment each day! I love helping others kickstart their journey along with being apart of this incredible community üå¥</p>

I always used to book my own travel and my friends and family's and that was purely just for fun! When I saw you can earn back from it i jumped at the opportunity and it was the best thing I ever done.</p>
                                <p>Over the years i have developed a huge passion for travelling the world and going to different destinations, my next holidays and my business is all I ever think about.</p>
                                <p>Not only has the business offered so much for me but the community is one of the greatest things about it. I have made so many lovely friendships and it's so refreshing to see and speak to so many girls like me who want more in life and to see the world.</p>
